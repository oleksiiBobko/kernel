kernel
======
This is initial project. Just another Linux like kernel for fun. Script _compile.sh_ creates kernel which is possible to be loaded with __GRUB__ and at once kernel has loaded _"Hello world"_ message will be displayed. Keep in mind that before loading krenel shoul be wrapped into load image. Use script _run_ to do this. Also up mentioned script launch kernel in __qemu__. You shoul install it first to see result. One who decide to develop his own OS should browse http://wiki.osdev.org. That resource full of greate tutorials and related topics.
