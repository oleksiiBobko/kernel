This is initial project. Just another Linux like kernel just for fun. Script compile.sh creates kernel which is possible to be loaded with GRUB and at once kernel has loaded "Hello world" message will be displayed. Notice that before loading krenel shoul be wrapped into load image. One can use script run to do this. Also up mentioned script lounche kernel in qemu. You shoul install it first to see result. One who decide to develop his own OS should browse http://wiki.osdev.org. That resource full of greate tutorials and related topics.
